This project is an online portal between students and faculty. This innovative system allows college faculty to share important data as well as notifications with engineering students. It consists of a faculty login along with student login. Since college faculty operate through pc and document uploading is simpler through a pc, the faculty login is to be performed through a computer. Faculty may upload documents of subject syllabus, timetable document, notifications, e notes etc through their provided login. The documents are uploaded by faculty to different corresponding departments. We propose to build this system on an online server that allows faculty to upload data and students may view search and download required documents through their android device. Here students only see and download data of their particular semester. Rest data is hidden. Faculty may access and upload/edit documents to any semester or add any notice as desired.


Features:
·User login: Allows student to login to their respective department

·Document details: This module stores documents in word and pdf format and also allows students to view particular data.
·Server management: The server smartly handles data and allows students with an android device to access data as well as faculty to upload document details.
·Faculty Upload: The system allows faculty to upload documents to server.
·Student Download: The system allows student to download only allowed semester data through his android phone using an active internet connection.
